title: Building A Writer His First Home
color: "#00bfa5"
folder: "brammer"
tags: [ 'Strategy', 'Web Development', 'Web Design' ]
task: "Freelance writer John Paul Brammer asked us to create a portfolio website that could be a comprehensive “home base” for readers and potential employers."
approach: "What made John stand out to us was his online persona. He is able to remain humorous and snarky while making profound statements and observations about gender, sexuality, and social issues. We wanted to keep focus on the content while showcasing the lighter side of John’s personality, visually juxtaposed with poilitical imagery. The result was a dynamic hub, where visitors could interact with John’s writing and immediately get a sense of his voice and personality."
