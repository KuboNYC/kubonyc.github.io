color: "#00bfa5"
folder: "brammer"

task: "Freelance writer John Paul Brammer asked us to create a portfolio website that could be a comprehensive “home base” for readers and potential employers."
approach: "What made John stand out to us was his online persona. He is able to remain humorous and snarky while making profound statements and observations about gender, sexuality, and social issues. We wanted to showcase the lighter side of John’s personality visually juxtaposed with poilitical imagery, keeping focus on the content. The result was a dynamic hub, where visitors could interact with John’s writing and immediately get a sense of his voice and personality."
